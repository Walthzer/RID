<h1>REALISTIC IED DEFUSAL</h1>

<h3>RID is an open source mod that aims to add realistic and complex mechanics into Arma 3 on the grounds of IED's. From Different trigger mechanism to an actual skill/knowlage based defusal minigame, RID seeks to implement a new level of IED disposal. Usages via either the Zeus interface (Advised) or utilising scripts.</h3>

<h2>FEATURES:</h2>

RID Consists of two major parts: an actual IED-Trigger connection network and the means to interact/disrupt said network. Instead of having triggers and IED just be 'connected' RID creates physical in-game representations of said connections, allowing them to be: Detected and Disrupted or unintentionally destroyed by combat.

The network allows for multiple IED to be connected on the fly to one trigger, vice versa or have multiple triggers trigger multiple IEDs. All via either Zeus or script.

<h3>Current Network Trigger Elements:</h3>
-Dynamic Tripwires<br />
-Dynamic Pressure Plates<br />
-Realistic 'Proximity detector' via 'vibration' simulation.<br />
-Manual detonation box<br />
-Options For Custom Additions with scripts.<br />

<h3>Current Network Connectors:</h3>
-Underground 'buried' cables

<h3>Current Network Receivers:</h3>
-IEDs<br />
-Options For Custom Additions with scripts.<br />
<br />
Besides making the connectivity of IEDs more immersive, RID also adds in a defusal minigame into IEDs themselves.
By using real life Circuit board analysis technics (limited to visual inspection, no tools are yet available) one must trace the correct wire connected to a circuitboard and cut it. But beware for anti-defusal countermeasures. One wrong cut and its over.

In order to make the Underground cables detectable to technician, RID also expands the ACE mine detectors with a UI to enable simultaneous detection of both mines and cables.

<h3>FUTURE:</h3>
- Cellphone based IEDs with celltower simulation<br />
- Radiowave detection trigger<br />
- Better documentation of RID<br />
